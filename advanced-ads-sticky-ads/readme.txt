== Description ==

Sticky Ads (or Anchor Ads for mobile) have proven to increase the income from click or performance based ads. This method is even more interesting on mobile devices, because users are already used to ads being fixed when using native apps.

The Sticky Ads plugin provides this functionality for those ads and ad networks that don’t offer ads that are fixed on the screen, but allow them.

Features

* position ads over the content so they don’t scroll
* header bar placement
* footer bar placement
* sidebar ads attached to the main wrapper placement
* sidebar ads attached to the window placement
* make ads sticky to the screen or let them be scrolled away
* add background color for header and footer bars
* allow users to close sticky placements for a specific time
* center side ads vertically
* fallback for fixed ads in case browsers don’t support this
* set delay in seconds after which the ad should show up
* display with effects (show, fade, slide)

== Installation ==

The Sticky Ads plugin is based on the free Advanced Ads plugin, a simple and powerful ad management solution for WordPress. Before using Sticky Ads download, install and activate Advanced Ads for free from http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/.
You can use Advanced Ads along any other ad management plugin and don’t need to switch completely.
